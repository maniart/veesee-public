                        With no priced financing round, no revenues, and no substantial assets, traditional finance theories can’t help entrepreneurs who want to establish the value of their startups.

                    <p>
                        Just as individuals were (perceived) to be unique, we look at startups as unique opportunities.

                        Loan officers used to call merchants and ask if an individual paid their bills on time. Similarly, startups keep their information private, and standardizing disparate data across companies is time consuming

                    <p>
                        1. Educate ourselves that companies, like people, are not that different from oneanother. They are all just trying to make money.
                    </p>   
                    <p>
                        2. Take lots of data, figure out which ones are important, standardize them, and look for trends

                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <h4>Why</h4>
                    <p>
                        Reduced cost of innovation means many of the paradigm shifting innovations are happening at the earlier stages of a company’s life cycle.
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        We wanted to create a tool that would enable entrepreneurs to set their company’s valuation based on better insight and clarity of the market, and help investors better communicate their reasoning behind their offers.

                    <h4>How</h4> 
                    <p>
                        We attended dozens of pitch events, talked to many more investors, and analyzed hundreds of pitch decks and term sheets. Our analysis showed that the value placed on a startup can be defined by the quality of the management team, the size of the market, stage of the product development, the established distribution channels, the competitive advantage, traction, and the network effect of these factors amongst each other.
